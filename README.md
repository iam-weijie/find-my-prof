# Find My Prof

Welcome to **Find My Prof** â€“ a platform designed to help McGill students make informed decisions about their classes by providing detailed insights into professors' teaching styles, use of quizzes, and more. The platform features an AI-powered assistant that utilizes data parsed from [Rate My Professors](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/) to answer your specific queries about professors.

## Overview

The project uses the following stack:

- Next.js
- JavaScript, Python
- Pinecone
- Material UI
- Gemini API

## Features

- **AI Assistant**: Ask our AI assistant specific questions about professors, such as "What is Professor X's teaching style?" or "Which professors explain concepts clearly?" and get accurate, data-driven answers.
- **Comprehensive Insights**: Go beyond ratings with detailed information on teaching methods, exam formats, and more, all derived from real student feedback.
